I had trouble getting the alignment extension working on windows, a lot of
version issues between ruby for some reason.  So instead I've set up a gem
that can be automatically installed.  The only downside is:

1)  Its not automatic, you need to run a script or actively install the gem.
2)  The windows machine needs the devkit installed (which is usually the case).
